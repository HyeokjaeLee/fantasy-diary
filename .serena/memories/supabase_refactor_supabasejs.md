- Replaced Hey API generated REST client usage in Escape From Seoul routes with Supabase JS service-role client helpers.
- Added shared Database typing (supabase/database.ts) and ensured supabaseServer exports a typed Supabase client reused across routes.
- Updated MCP tools and TRPC mutation handlers to query Supabase directly and added safe fallbacks/defaults when mapping existing records.
- Removed @supabase-api client configuration from providers; Supabase access now centralized in Supabase JS clients.
